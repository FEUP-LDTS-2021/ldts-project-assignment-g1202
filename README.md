## LPOO_<12><02> - Dungeon Boy

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Dungeon Boy is a game in which the player goes through different levels and maps and faces different enemies until reaching the final boss. It has 2 playing modes, the Survival mode in which the player has to survive through some tough fights with enemies, The Player vs Player mode (PVP) consists in a mode where the player can face a player 2, and the winner will be crowned on the best results out of 5 intense rounds!

This project was developed by João Duarte (201707984), Miguel Tavares( ) and Inês Garcia ( ) for LDTS 2021-22.


### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **Connected Menus** - The user has the capability of browsing through the different menus including in game ones. (Ex: Intro Menu, Main Menu with mode selection screens, Instructions,  Shop(when dead) and ESC.
- **Keyboard control** - The keyboard inputs are received and interpreted according to the current game state.
- **Player control** - The player may move and attack the enemies with the keyboard control.
- **Collisions detection** - Collisions between the player and the enemies are verified.
- **Hit Points** - If the player collides or is attacked by an enemie, loses hit points. 
- **Diferent enemies** - The player will face different enemies throughout the game.
- **Different modes** - The player can choose between the Survival Mode and the Player vs Player mode.
- **Shop interaction and money management** - The player may buy new items in the in game shop, which consist of new weapons and potions, shop is only available after dying on Survival mode.
- **Catching HP Potions** - If the player goes to the position of a potion, this one is going to be collected, adding 10 health points to his total HP.
- **Lives** - In the beggining of the game, the player is given 3 lives (displayed in health on the screen).
- **Dying** - A player dies if his health reaches 0, or less.


### PLANNED FEATURES


- **Player control** - The player may move and attack the enemies with the keyboard control.
- **Collisions detection** - Collisions (still need to be implemented)
- **Diferent enemies** - The player will face different enemies throughout the game.  (still need to be implemented)
- **Shop interaction and money management** - (still need to be implemented)
- **Catching HP Potions** - If the player goes to the position of a potion, this one is going to be collected, adding 10 health points to his total HP. (still need to be implemented)
- **Final Boss** - (still need to be implemented)


### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

**Example of one of such subsections**:

#### THE JUMP ACTION OF THE KANGAROOBOY SHOULD BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON ITS STATE

**Problem in Context**

There was a lot of scattered conditional logic when deciding how the KangarooBoy should behave when jumping, as the jumps should be different depending on the items that came to his possession during the game (an helix will alow him to fly, driking a potion will allow him to jump double the height, etc.). This is a violation of the **Single Responsability Principle**. We could concentrate all the conditional logic in the same method to circumscribe the issue to that one method but the **Single Responsability Principle** would still be violated.

**The Pattern**

We have applied the **State** pattern. This pattern allows you to represent different states with different subclasses. We can switch to a different state of the application by switching to another implementation (i.e., another subclass). This pattern allowed to address the identified problems because […].

**Implementation**

The following figure shows how the pattern’s roles were mapped to the application classes.

These classes can be found in the following files:

- [Character](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/Character.java)
- [JumpAbilityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/JumpAbilityState.java)
- [DoubleJumpState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/DoubleJumpState.java)
- [HelicopterState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/HelicopterState.java)
- [IncreasedGravityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/IncreasedGravityState.java)

**Consequences**

The use of the State Pattern in the current design allows the following benefits:

- The several states that represent the character’s hability to jump become explicit in the code, instead of relying on a series of flags.
- We don’t need to have a long set of conditional if or switch statements associated with the various states; instead, polimorphism is used to activate the right behavior.
- There are now more classes and instances to manage, but still in a reasonable number.

#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS AND REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.

**Example of such a subsection**:

------

#### DATA CLASS

The `PlatformSegment` class is a **Data Class**, as it contains only fields, and no behavior. This is problematic because […].

A way to improve the code would be to move the `isPlatformSegmentSolid()` method to the `PlatformSegment` class, as this logic is purely concerned with the `PlatformSegment` class.
